What follows are the (decorated) notes I'm taking while trying to understand
how to have Watson Assistant and its associated tooling work in a
git/CLI/collaborative world.

== Watson Assistant Workbench?

https://github.com/IBM/watson-assistant-workbench[Waston Assistant Workbench]
has some rough edges around consumability, is unmaintained since Oct 2019,
uses Python 3.5... but they seem to have taken care of the readability and
"_diff_-ability" of the dialog definition.

It also manages cloud functions, which would be of help in some ongoing
internal project that uses functions without version tracking.

=== Running WAW unit tests

I was lucky that I had pre-existing Cloud Functions namespaces, because the
way WAW manages credentials it expects a CF-based namespace (with an API key in
the form `user:password`), and those currently cannot be created. 
  
Hold it: I think that if I use `apikey` as the user it may work...

```
$ conda env create -f requirements.yml
$ conda activate wa-cli
$ set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport
$ pushd ../tools/watson-assistant-workbench
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
$ PYTHONPATH=./scripts:$PYTHONPATH pytest ci/unit_tests
  ...
  12 failed, 167 passed, 41 skipped, 39 warnings, 7 errors in 13.91s
$ PYTHONPATH=./scripts:$PYTHONPATH pytest ci/app_tests
  ...
  2 failed, 3 passed in 5.73s
```

We are getting 403s from
https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api/v1/workspaces?version=2017-02-03

And it is to be expected. From https://github.com/cognitive-catalyst/WA-Testing-Tool/blob/master/config.ini.sample#L3 

```
; Update the url for the WA API to match your specific WA region
; url patterns are found at https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant/assistant-v1#service-endpoint
iam_apikey =
url = https://api.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com

; Instances created before December 13, 2019 have a url with this pattern
;url = https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api
```

It is also breaking in the Cloud Functions related code:

* Testing Python 2 runtime (no longer supported)
* Testing no-CF namespaces: The API now requires
  an oauth token, and there are some other changes.

But this gave better results (unless you hit the rate limit. Sigh). Note that I
had to edit `ci/app_tests/generateAndTestWorkspace_data/test.cfg` in order to make
the second test work.

```
$ PYTHONPATH=./scripts:$PYTHONPATH TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE=cron pytest -k 'not functions' ci/unit_tests
  ...
  131 passed, 96 deselected, 5 warnings in 33.16s
$ PYTHONPATH=./scripts:$PYTHONPATH pytest -k 'not TestAndEvaluateFunction' ci/app_tests
  ...
  4 passed, 1 deselected in 46.53s
```
